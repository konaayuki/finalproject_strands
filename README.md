# finalproject_strands

Hello! Welcome to our version of Strands, a word game originally created by the New York Times. 
Here is a link to the original New York Times version: https://www.nytimes.com/games/strands 

In Strands, the rules are as follows: 
The player is presented with a board of clickable letters and given a theme. The player must, by clicking letters on the screen, create words related to that theme. When the last letter of the word is double clicked, is it checked to ensure that it is part of the theme. If it is, those letters are highlighted in yellow. 

The player must continue until the entire board is filled with theme words. 

The New York Times version includes a hint button, activated when the player guesses three words that are not in the theme, and we hope to integrate this in another version. 

To run our code, you must download the following packages: pygame, requests, random, string, and os. 

As of now, our code still has a few issues related to correctly checking and registering words. While the words that a player enters are correctly stored in a list of theme words, Mia has (as of now) not been able to integrate board color updates with the word checking process. 

Team member hours and contributions are stored in the group project proposal form attached to this repository.
