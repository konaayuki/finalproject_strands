# finalproject_strands

Hello! Welcome to our version of Strands, a word game originally created by the New York Times. 
Here is a link to the original New York Times version: https://www.nytimes.com/games/strands 

In Strands, the rules are as follows: 
The player is presented with a board of clickable letters and given a theme. The player must, by clicking letters on the screen, create words related to that theme. Once the word is found in the right spot, click on the 'CHECK' button to highlight in blue. The player must continue until the entire board is filled with theme words. 

Clicking on outside the board area will unselect the unchecked gray letters. If the checked words do not match up with the given gameboard, the player is allowed to reset the whole board via 'RESET' button.

The New York Times version includes a hint button, activated when the player guesses three words that are not in the theme, and we hope to integrate this in another version. 

To run our code, you must download the following packages: pygame, requests, random, string, and os.
