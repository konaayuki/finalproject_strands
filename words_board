#GENERATE 6 BY 8 EMPTY GAMEBOARD
rows = 6
cols = 8
grid = []

for i in range(rows):
    row = []
    for i in range(cols):
        row.append(0)  # Fill the grid with 0s
    grid.append(row)

for row in grid:
    print(row) #print grid

#Steps:
#Initialize the game board as a list with the dimensions 6x8 (6 columns, 8 rows)
#Begin by placing the spanagram which must touch 2 opposite sides of the board
#Loop through each theme word and attempt to place it on the board
#Check that each theme word can be placed horizontally or vertically without overlapping any existing words
#If a word can be placed without overlap, add it to the board
#Repeat this until all of the theme words are placed
#If the function can not place each word without overlap, create a backtrack function that will try other positions/directions
